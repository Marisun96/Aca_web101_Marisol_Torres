Inline css- For Inline CSS every style content is in HTML elements. It is used for a limited section. Whenever our requirements are very small we can use inline CSS.

            It will affect only single elements. In HTML we require that various HTML tag’s views are different so then we use inline Cascading Style Sheets. There are disadvantage of inline Cascading Style Sheets. It must be specified on every HTML tag.
            -2.Internal Css- In internal CSS the style of CSS is specified in the <head> section. This is internal CSS, it affects all the elements in the body section. Internal CSS is used in the condition when we want a style to be used in the complete HTML body. For that we can use style in the head tag.
            
            This style performs an action in the entire HTML body.
            3. External Css- In External CSS we create a .css file and use it in our HTML page as per our requirements. Generally external Cascading Style Sheets are used whenever we have many HTML attributes and we can use them as required; there is no need to rewrite the CSS style again and again in a complete body of HTML that inherits the property of the CSS file.

The style sheets define the color, size and position of text and other HTML tags, while the HTML files define the content and how it is organised.

                You have met selectors already. A CSS selector is the first part of a CSS Rule. It is a pattern of elements and other terms that tell the browser which HTML elements should be selected to have the CSS property values inside the rule applied to them. The element or elements which are selected by the selector are referred to as the subject of the selector.
